This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To run, git clone and npm start. 

The aim of this project was to integrate with a weather API, to take a city name from a user and return the weather for their chosen location. 

This is still a work in progress as I need to add unit tests, and some minor functionality, for example, displaying the temperature in Celsius or Farenheight based on the users choice. I also need to amend some class based components into functional components.
